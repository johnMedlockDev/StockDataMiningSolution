For https://www.alphavantage.co API.

The project just hits all the of the fundamental end points, creates json out of the data, and persist that data to SQL server. I did it with the Premium api key and pulled all of the their data in about 2 days after everything was all said and done. If you use the free api key you'll probably have to troubleshoot some errors. Also, I have a mdf with like 150k records so good luck with that. The timeout is rated for their cheapest package.
